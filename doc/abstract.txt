## Motivation {-}
Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC/MS)
bacame a routinely used technique in differential proteomics studies.
LC/MS proteomics data is processed in multiple stages.
An important processing step is the retention time alignment,
which aims at correcting non-linear retention time shifts
between LC/MS runs [@podwojski_retention_2009].
Noumerous algorithms have been previously presented to solve this problem.
They are usually based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and have
quadratic computational complexity for memory and also computing time.

## Results {-}
We present an intuitive and efficient algorithm for pairwise
retention time alignment between LC/MS peak lists in linear time an space.
The algorithm combines previously introduced techniques.
Using the idea of Hirschberg algorithm for the Longest Common Substring (LCS)
problem, DTW's space complexity is reduced to linear [@hirschberg_linear_1975].
In combination with the iterative refinment windowing techniques inspired
by FastDTW[@salvador_fastdtw:_2007], we also linearize the algorithm's time complexity.
Similar to FastDTW we precalculate coarse time alignments on downsampled peak lists
and iteratively use these prealignments to reduce the search space at the next sampling stage,
eventually aligning complete peak lists.
The algorithm performance can be controlled by radius parameter.
The downsampling of peak lists is done by selecting representative peaks by their masses.

## Discussion {-}
The mathematical basis of Hirschberg's LCS algirithm enables 
parallelized computation of the alignment utilizing recent multiprocessor or GPU based techniques.
